## About Me
My story started in college. I studied to be a CNC programmer, I was hooked on the topic of machine programming. I was the best on the course, showed a good result. After training, I got a job as a CNC operator, and in one year I grew up to a master, I conducted interviews, set up equipment.

At that moment, I realized that I like writing code, working in a team, performing and setting tasks. I decided to change my field of work. I liked the front-end development because I love the visual result. I have been fond of programming for a long time, but before that I devoted only my free time to it for my own pleasure. Now I have taken up a full-fledged study.
 ### Of my strengths, one can emphasize:
  + interest in learning new technologies
  + respect for criticism
  + the ability to work in a team
  + accomplishing tasks
