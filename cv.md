## About Me
My story started in college. I studied to be a CNC programmer, I was hooked on the topic of machine programming. I was the best on the course, showed a good result. After training, I got a job as a CNC operator, and in one year I grew up to a master, I conducted interviews, set up equipment.

At that moment, I realized that I like writing code, working in a team, performing and setting tasks. I decided to change my field of work. I liked the front-end development because I love the visual result. I have been fond of programming for a long time, but before that I devoted only my free time to it for my own pleasure. Now I have taken up a full-fledged study.

### Categorize New Member
The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior and Open. They would like your help with an application form that will tell prospective members which category they will be placed.

To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7. In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better the player the lower the handicap.

### Input
Input will consist of a list of pairs. Each pair contains information for a single potential member. Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.

### Output
Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell and C: Open or Senior) stating whether the respective member is to be placed in the senior or open category.
### Example
```
    input =  [[18, 20], [45, 2], [61, 12], [37, 6], [21, 21], [78, 9]]
    output = ["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open", "Senior"]
```
#### JavaScript:
```
function openOrSenior(data){
    let arr = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++){
        if (data[i][0] >= 55 && data[i][1] > 7){
            arr.push('Senior');
        } else {
            arr.push('Open');
        }
    }
    return arr;
 }
 ```
